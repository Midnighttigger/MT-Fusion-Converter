# MT-Fusion-Converter V0.4
Converter between multiple ctm formats by Midnighttigger  

# Info
The converter requires Python & Pillow in order to run, you may then execute the file.  
"import folder" is where images go to be converted, folders under would need to be made in order for images & a setup file in each of these folders.  
Info on formats can be shown in "readmeformats.png".  
The image import type is what format is the image your importing.  
The image export type is what format the image your exporting.  
The base is the size of each png per block (default is 16 but some texturepacks require different ones such as 64x ones), the base MUST be an even integer greater than 1.  
In each setup.txt, the first line is the import type (number), second line is export type (number), third line is the base.  
An example will be shown in each release which can be found in the github folder "releases".  
Default Export type can be defined by setting it as "0" and it will use export types as shown with the green numbers in readmeformats.png
Orange Groups represents which formats you can convert between aka you can convert between Optifine CTM_Compact and Fusion Full but not with something like Fusion Horizontal
