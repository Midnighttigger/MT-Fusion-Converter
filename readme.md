# MT-Fusion-Converter V0.1
Converter between multiple ctm formats by Midnighttigger

# Info
The converter requires Python & Pillow in order to run, you may then execute the file
"import folder" is where images go to be converted, folders under would need to be made in order for images & a setup file in each of these folders.
Info on formats can be shown in "readmeformats.png"
The image import type is what format is the image your importing
The image export type is what format the image your exporting
The base is the size of each png per block (default is 16 but some texturepacks require different ones such as 64x ones), the base MUST be an even integer greater than 1
In each setup.txt, the first line is the import type (number), second line is export type (number), third line is the base
An example will be shown in each release which can be found in the github folder "releases"
